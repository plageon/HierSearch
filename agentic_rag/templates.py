In case of conflicting information from the two agents, the local search agent's information is considered more reliable. \
You need to carefully scrutinize the evidences, hypotheses, and conclusions from both agents. \
If you find that the information from neither agent is sufficient to answer the question, \
you can revise the question and invoke the search agents again. \
You can invoke the agents using <all_search_agent> question </all_search_agent> for both agents, \
